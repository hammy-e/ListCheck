About ListCheck:

- ListCheck is a simple and elegant task reminder app that makes sure you keep your life organized and up to date. The today tab in the app allows users to only focus on what is needed to be done today which increases productivity and keeps priorites in check. ListCheck was built based on simplicity, an app with no gimmicks and useless 'features' that waste time off your day that could instead be used on completing your tasks. Just simply set a title, a brief description, and the date due for reminding you, and you are good to go, ListCheck will take care of the rest.
